# Get started with JavaScript using a community module

## Introduction

Before jumping into the description of JavaScript features and all their details let's begin with a practical example. Enhancing data quality is a focus area for many businesses. Data quality that is lacking prevents analysts from making properly informed decisions, and it all starts at the source system. In this lab you will read about validating email addresses, a common scenario in many applications. Validating email addresses isn't a new problem, and there are plenty of solutions available. This lab explores the open source `validator.js` module's `isEmail()` function and demonstrates how to use it in your application.

> If you intend to use `validator.js` in your own project please refer to validator's GitHub project site for more details about the project's license and implications of use.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Create a schema to store the JavaScript module
- Download the ECMAScript version of the `validator.js` module
- Create an MLE module in the database
- Expose the module to PL/SQL and SQL
- Validate email addresses

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

- Oracle Database 23c Free - Developer Release
- You have a working noVNC environment or comparable setup

## Task 1: Create a schema to store the JavaScript module

All the steps in this lab can either be completed in `sqlplus` or `sqlcl`. The instructions refer to `sqlplus` but apart from the initial connection the two options are identical.

1. Start by connecting to the database as `SYS`

    ```sql
    <copy>sqlplus / as sysdba</copy>
    ```

    Should you get the message `connected to an idle instance` or `sqlplus: command not found` you need to source the correct environment variables first:

    ```bash
    <copy>ORACLE_SID=FREE ORAENV_ASK=NO source oraenv</copy>
    ```

    Verify the success by echoing both `ORACLE_SID` and `ORACLE_HOME`:

    ```bash
    <copy>echo "ORACLE_SID is set to ${ORACLE_SID} for ORACLE_HOME ${ORACLE_HOME}"</copy>
    ```

    If you see the following output on your screen you are all set:

    ```
    ORACLE_SID is set to FREE for ORACLE_HOME /opt/oracle/product/23c/dbhomeFree
    ```

2. Once you are successfully connected to the database, switch to the pre-created Pluggable Database (PDB) `freepdb1`

    ```sql
    SQL> <copy>alter session set container = freepdb1;</copy>
    ```

3. Create a new user in freepdb1 with the necessary privileges to create, store and run JavaScript code

    Next you need to prepare the creation of the developer account. The instructions in the following snippet create a new account, named `jstest`. It will be used to store JavaScript modules in the database.

    ```sql
    <copy>set echo on
    drop user if exists jstest cascade;

    create user jstest identified by &secretpassword
    default tablespace users quota unlimited on users;

    grant create session to jstest;
    grant db_developer_role to jstest;
    grant execute on javascript to jstest;

    host mkdir /home/oracle/hol23c

    drop directory if exists javascript_src_dir;
    create directory javascript_src_dir as '/home/oracle/hol23c';
    grant read, write on directory javascript_src_dir to jstest;

    exit</copy>
    ```

    Save the snippet in a file, for example `${HOME}/hol23c/setup.sql` and execute it in `sqlplus`. You should still be connected to `freebdb1` as `SYS` as per the previous step. If not, connect to `freepdb1` as `SYS`.

    ```sql
    <copy>
    start ${HOME}/hol23c/setup.sql
    </copy>
    ```

    Here is the output of an execution:

    ```
    SQL> @hol23c/setup
    SQL> drop user if exists jstest cascade;

    User dropped.

    SQL> create user jstest identified by &secretpassword
      2  default tablespace users quota unlimited on users;
    Enter value for secretpassword: yoursupersecretpasswordhere
    old   1: create user jstest identified by &secretpassword
    new   1: create user jstest identified by yoursupersecretpasswordhere

    User created.

    SQL> grant create session to jstest;

    Grant succeeded.

    SQL> grant db_developer_role to jstest;

    Grant succeeded.

    SQL> grant execute on javascript to jstest;

    Grant succeeded.

    SQL> host mkdir /home/oracle/hol23c 2> /dev/null || echo "no need to create the directory, it exists"

    SQL> drop directory if exists javascript_src_dir;

    Directory dropped.

    SQL> create directory javascript_src_dir as '/home/oracle/hol23c';

    Directory created.

    SQL> grant read, write on directory javascript_src_dir to jstest;

    Grant succeeded.

    SQL> exit
    ```

    You will be prompted you for a password to be assigned to the user. Please remember the password, you will need it later.

4. ORDS-enable the new schema

    With the new account created you need to enable it for use with Oracle Restful Data Service (ORDS). You will point Database Actions against the schema in later modules. Connect to the database as the `jstest` user:

    ```bash
    <copy>sqlplus jstest/yourNewPasswordGoesHere@localhost/freepdb1</copy>
    ```

    REST-enable the schema by calling `ords.enable_schema()`

    ```sql
    <copy>
    begin
        ords.enable_schema;
        commit;
    end;
    /
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 2: Get the ECMAScript version of the validator.js module

The `validator` module can be downloaded from multiple sources. As long as you pick a trustworthy one it doesn't really matter where the file originates from. Ensure that you get the ECMAScript (ESM) version of the module from your preferred Content Delivery Network (CDN) as they are the only ones supported in Oracle. The necessary file has been staged on Object Storage and can be copied to the directory pointed at by `javascript_src_dir` as follows:

```bash
curl -Lo /home/oracle/hol23c/validator.min.js 'https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/VEKec7t0mGwBkJX92Jn0nMptuXIlEpJ5XJA-A6C9PymRgY2LhKbjWqHeB5rVBbaV/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/data-management-library-files/validator.min.jsvalidator.min.js'
```

## Task 3: Create the JavaScript module in the database

JavaScript in Oracle Database 23c Free - Developer Release allows you to load JavaScript modules using the `BFILE` clause, specifying a directory object and file name. You prepared for the `create mle module` command in the previous step, now it's time to execute it:

1. Connect to the database as the `jstest` user:

    ```bash
    <copy>sqlplus jstest/yourNewPasswordGoesHere@localhost/freepdb1</copy>
    ```

2. With the session established, create the module as follows:

    ```sql
    <copy>
    create  mle module validator
    language javascript
    using bfile (javascript_src_dir, 'validator.min.js');
    /
    </copy>
    ```

3. Verify the module has been created:

    ```sql
    <copy>
    col MODULE_NAME for a30
    col LANGUAGE_NAME for a30

    select 
        module_name, 
        language_name 
    from 
        user_mle_modules
    where
        module_name = 'VALIDATOR';</copy>
    ```

    The query should return exactly 1 row as shown here:

    ```
    MODULE_NAME                    LANGUAGE_NAME
    ------------------------------ ------------------------------
    VALIDATOR                      JAVASCRIPT
    ```

You can read more about creating JavaScript modules in Oracle Database 23c Free - Developer release in chapter 2 of the JavaScript Developer's Guide.

## Task 4: Expose the module's functionality to PL/SQL and SQL

With the module successfully created in the schema the hardest part is complete. The validator module exposes quite a few string validators for any purpose imaginable, the project's GitHub page lists them all in a convenient tabular format. As per the introduction to this lab the goal is to validate email addresses. A PL/SQL call specification links the module's JavaScript functions to SQL and PL/SQL. In this simple case a stand-alone function does the trick:

```sql
<copy>
create or replace function isEmail(
  p_str varchar2
) return boolean
as mle module validator
signature 'default.isEmail';
/
</copy>
```

The validator library's `index.js` (in src/index.js in the projectâ€™s Github repository) declares the validator object as the module's default export, requiring the use of the `default` keyword in the function's signature.

In case where multiple JavaScript functions are made available to PL/SQL and SQL you should follow the industry's best practice and encapsulate them in a package.

Please refer to chapter 5 in the JavaScript Developer's Guide for more information about call specifications and module calls.

## Task 5: Validate email addresses

After the JavaScript module has been created in the schema and exposed to SQL and PL/SQL it can be used like any other PL/SQL code unit. Go ahead and validate a few email addresses:

```sql
<copy>
select isEmail('user-no-domain') as test1;
select isEmail('@domain.but.no.user') as test2;
select isEmail('user@example.com') as test3;
</copy>
```

You can see that the function works as expected:

```
SQL> select isEmail('user-no-domain') as test1;

TEST1
-----------
FALSE

SQL> select isEmail('@domain.but.no.user') as test2;

TEST2
-----------
FALSE

SQL> select isEmail('user@example.com') as test3;

TEST3
-----------
TRUE
```
